      <div class="tab-pane active" id="australian-shepherd"><p>The Australian Shepherd, lovingly called an "Aussie," is a highly intelligent, incredibly energetic, people-loving dog who needs to have a job to do. They need lots and lots of exercise and will fit in well with an active person or family. They are bred to herd, and might try to herd anything, including you, your children, your neighbor's child on a bicycle, innocent strangers jogging past your house, ducks, squirrels, cats, and cars. You will need a fence to keep them off the road. They also have strong guarding instincts, and want to be near their family at all times. Originally bred as all-purpose farm dogs, Aussies were left to supervise the children while the parents worked in the fields. They are good with children, except for the occasional nipping at their heels to herd them into position. They will follow you from room to room and supervise you in the bathroom. They are very affectionate and will want to lick your face. They are assertive by nature, highly territorial and can be pushy. They are very protective of their family and home, and are cautious around strangers. They need lots of mental stimulation and physical exercise, or problem behaviors will arise. They are the opposite of the couch potato dog. They need to have a sense of purpose, which is why so many of them excel in obedience and agility competitions. They are highly trainable, versatile, and are quick learners. They usually love to play ball and Frisbee, and many of them enjoy swimming. If you are in the market for a full-time center of attention family pet, full of exuberance and demanding of your attention, then an Aussie might be for you. They are good-natured, eager to please, and remarkably loyal. But they will need to be at the top of your priority list.</p></div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="welsh-corgi"><p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi equals big personality in a little dog. These are intelligent, active, alert little guys who will want to be the center of your world. They love to be with their families, and will shower you with loyalty, devotion and affection. They need daily exercise and love to take long walks with you. They are intelligent and eager to please and do great with obedience training. They excel in obedience, agility, flyball, Frisbee, herding, and tracking competitions. They get along very well with respectful children, but parents need to be aware that Corgis might try to herd kids. (They also might try to herd other animals and your houseguests.) Most Corgis like to be with other cats and dogs. They are adaptable dogs and can live anywhere as long as they get walked, but they do like to bark, so close neighbors might object. While personalities differ within the breed, in general, the Corgi is even-tempered, hardy, friendly, loyal and loving. And they are always full of fun.</p></div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="shiba-inu"><p>The Shiba Inu is a unique breed. Intelligent, active, energetic, they think pretty highly of themselves. They are famous for their spirited boldness and independent nature. If you are not careful, they will train you. Early obedience training is important, but even then, Shibas don't really enjoy being obedient. Off leash work is especially challenging and the recall might require a miracle. They love to run and they love to run away. They are escape artists and owners must be careful every single time they open a door because they will bolt. Some can even climb chain link fences. Shibas have been known to disappear for days at a time. They will hunt mice, squirrels, and other small animals if they can. Shibas need regular exercise but a spirited 30 minute walk each day should suffice. They are good watchdogs and only bark when there is a reason. They are reserved toward strangers. They tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, and can coexist peacefully with cats, but if a cat runs away, there's a good chance the Shiba will chase it. Shibas will do well with older, well-behaved children, but some are afraid of young children and alarmed by their squeals and quick movements. Many Shibas will run and hide from toddlers. If the toddler pursues the dog, it could easily result in a fear-biting incident. While a Shiba can be sweet, you will earn whatever affection you get. They are not lapdogs and prefer to sit beside you, not on you. They are not particularly cuddly and don't really like to be held. They spend a lot of time on their own, enjoying some quiet solitude. Because they don't really like to be touched or handled, grooming can be a real challenge. They are generally quiet, but do possess the Shiba scream -- a high-pitched banshee call. They let this scream go whenever they are unhappy, and it can be a bit embarrassing. They can be a bit of a drama queen. But despite all of the breed's idiosyncrasies, Shiba owners will tell you they are the best breed in the world: funny, loyal, playful and fast to housetrain. So if you want a dog who thinks he's smarter than you, and will try to push your buttons, then you might consider the beautiful, athletic, energetic Shiba.</p></div>
